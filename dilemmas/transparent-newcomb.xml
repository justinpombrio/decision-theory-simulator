<dilemma name="Transparent Newcomb's Problem" xml-author="Justin Pombrio">
    <description>
        Events transpire as they do in Newcomb's problem, except that this
        time both boxes are transparent---so the agent can see exactly what
        decision the predictor made before making her own decision. The
        predictor placed $1,000,000 in box B iff She predicted that the
        agent would leave behind box A (which contains $1,000) upon seeing
        that both boxes are full. In the case where the agent faces two full
        boxes, should she leave the $1,000 behind?
        ------
        Wording taken from "Functional Decision Theory" by Yudkowski and Soares,
        with the following modifications:
        - Reduced predictor's accuracy from 99% to 98% so that it can be 1%
          inaccurate in each direction.
        - Capitalized "She", in proper deference to God-like entities.
