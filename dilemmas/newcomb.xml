    <description>
        An agent finds herself standing in front of a transparent box labeled
        "A" that contains $1,000, and an opaque box labeled "B" that contains
        either $1,000,000 or $0. A reliable predictor, who has made similar
        predictions in the past and has been correct 98% of the time, claims
        to have placed $1,000,000 in box B iff She predicted that the agent
        would leave box A behind. The predictor has already made Her
        prediction and left. Box B is now empty or full. Should the agent take
        both boxes ("two-boxing"), or only box B, leaving the transparent box
        containing $1,000 behind ("one-boxing")?
        ------
        Wording taken from "Functional Decision Theory" by Yudkowski and Soares,
        with the following modifications:
        - Reduced predictor's accuracy from 99% to 98% so that it can be 1%
          inaccurate in each direction.
        - Capitalized "She", in proper deference to God-like entities.
