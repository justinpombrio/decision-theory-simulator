        Omega appears and says that it has just tossed a fair coin, and given
        that the coin came up tails, it decided to ask you to give it $100.
        Whatever you do in this situation, nothing else will happen differently
        in reality as a result. Naturally you don't want to give up your $100.
        But Omega also tells you that if the coin came up heads instead of tails,
        it'd give you $10000, but only if you'd agree to give it $100 if the coin
        came up tails. Do you give Omega $100?
