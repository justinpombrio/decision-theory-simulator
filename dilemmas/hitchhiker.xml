        An agent is dying in the desert. A driver comes along who offers to give
        the agent a ride into the city, but only if the agent will agree to
        visit an ATM once they arrive and give the driver $1,000. The driver
        will have no way to enforce this after they arrive, but she does have an
        extraordinary ability to detect lies with 98% accuracy. Being left to
        die causes the agent to lose the equivalent of $1,000,000. In the case
        where the agent gets to the city, should she proceed to visit the ATM
        and pay the driver?
        ------
        Wording taken from "Functional Decision Theory" by Yudkowski and Soares,
        with the following modifications:
        - Accuracy reduced from 99% to 98% so that it can be 1% inaccurate
          in each direction.
