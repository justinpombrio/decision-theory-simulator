<dilemma name="Smoking Lesion Problem" xml-author="Justin Pombrio">
    <description>
        An agent is debating whether or not to smoke. She knows that smoking is
        correlated with an invariably fatal variety of lung cancer, but the
        correlation is (in this imaginary world) entirely due to a common cause:
        an arterial lesion that causes those afflicted with it to love smoking
        and also (99% of the time) causes them to develop lung cancer. There is
        no direct causal link between smoking and lung cancer. Agents without
        this lesion contract lung cancer only 1% of the time, and an agent can
        neither directly observe nor control whether she suffers from the lesion.
        The agent gains utility equivalent to $1,000 by smoking (regardless of
        whether she dies soon), and gains utility equivalent to $1,000,000 if
        she doesnâ€™t die of cancer. Should she smoke, or refrain?
