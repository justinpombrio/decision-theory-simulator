<dilemma name="Cosmic Ray Problem" xml-author="Justin Pombrio">
    <description>
        An agent must choose whether to take $1 or $100. With vanishingly small
        probability, a cosmic ray will cause her to do the opposite of what she
        would have done otherwise. If she learns that she has been affected by a
        cosmic ray in this way, she will need to go to the hospital and pay
        $1,000 for a check-up. Should she take the $1, or the $100?
        ------
        Wording taken from "Functional Decision Theory" by Yudkowski and Soares.
        I've taken "vanishingly small" as merely "one in a thousand chance",
        to keep the numbers larger for readability.
