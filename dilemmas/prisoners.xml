    <description>
        Two agents, Alice and Bob, must both choose to either "cooperate" or
        "defect". If both cooperate, they each receive $1,000,000. If both
        defect, they each receive $1,000. If one cooperates and the other
        defects, the defector gets $1,001,000 and the cooperator gets nothing.
        Alice decides first, though Bob will not know her decision until he
        has made his. The agents both know the situation they are in, and
        that they use the same decision theory. Should Alice cooperate?
