<dilemma name="Death in Damascus" xml-author="Justin Pombrio">
    <description>
        Imagine a deterministic world where Death is known to be able to
        perfectly predict human behavior based on a detailed past observation
        of the worldâ€™s state. Death works from an appointment book, which
        lists combinations of people, days, and places. Each day, Death goes to
        collect the listed people at the listed places. If the listed person is
        at the corresponding place on that day, they die; otherwise, they
        survive (which they value at $1,000,000). An agent encounters Death in
        Damascus and is told that Death is coming for her tomorrow. This agent
        knows that deciding to flee to Aleppo (at a cost of $1,000) means that
        Death will be in Aleppo tomorrow, whereas staying in Damascus means that
        Death will be in Damascus tomorrow. Should she stay, or flee?

        Note that I've implemented the utility as +1000,000 for living and +1000
        for staying in Damascus.
