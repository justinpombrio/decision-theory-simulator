        Sleeping Beauty volunteers to undergo the following experiment and is
        told all of the following details: On Sunday she will be put to sleep.
        Once or twice, during the experiment, Sleeping Beauty will be awakened,
        interviewed, and put back to sleep with an amnesia-inducing drug that
        makes her forget that awakening. A fair coin will be tossed to determine
        which experimental procedure to undertake:

        - If the coin comes up heads, Sleeping Beauty will be awakened and
          interviewed on Monday only.
        - If the coin comes up tails, she will be awakened and interviewed on
          Monday and Tuesday.

        In either case, she will be awakened on Wednesday without interview and
        the experiment ends.

        Any time Sleeping Beauty is awakened and interviewed she will not be
        able to tell which day it is or whether she has been awakened before.
        During the interview Sleeping Beauty is asked: "What is your credence
        now for the proposition that the coin landed heads?"
        ------
        Wording taken from Wikipedia
        (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleeping_Beauty_problem).

        INFOHAZARD: This question is a [scissors statement]
        (https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/10/30/sort-by-controversial/).
        Be careful discussing it with others, as it easily leads to heated
        arguments.

        The Decision Theory Simulator, however, will not confront the crux of
        the problem (whether the 'credence' is 1/2 or 1/3). Instead, we'll
        embed two bets into the dilemma, and check that the agent makes the bets
        correctly. (Readers who say the 'credence' is 1/2 vs. 1/3 will give
        different probabilities for everything, and each will think that one of
        the two bets is unfair. However, they will both ultimately agree with
        each other on how to bet.)

        The two bets are:

        - Bet1: On Monday, Sleeping Beauty will be offered to pay $4, and
          receive $10 if the coin landed on heads. On Tuesday, she will also be
          "offered" this bet, but it won't count and if she takes it her $4 will
          be returned to her later. This is so that she can't tell whether it's
          Monday or Tuesday based on whether she received this offer to bet.
          (She should take this bet.)
        - Bet2: Each day she is awakened, Sleeping Beauty will be offered to pay
          $4, and receive $10 if the coin landed on heads. This bet is real on
          both Mondays and Tuesdays. (She should not take this bet.)
